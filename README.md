I’m Hamza and im a Cyber Security student at Aston University

I love to learn about how systems work, how they break, and how to secure them properly.
I spend a lot of my time learning outside of uni through my home labs and personal projects, which is 
where i like to experiment things like web security, basic hacking techniques like SQL injection and networking.
I always like to get hands one and figure things out by actualy doing it rather than reading about it.
Im always curious about cyber and tech and this github will be my documentation for my projects and experiments.


Tech Skils:
Front-end web development (HTML & CSS & JavaScript)

Python scripting for automation and problem-solving

Web security fundamentals (basic SQL injection)

Hands-on cybersecurity practice through home labs
